Project Description: This project aims to solve the decryption problem of messages encrypted using the Vigenère Cipher. The Vigenère Cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that encrypts text using a repeating keyword. The project focuses on decrypting messages encrypted with the Vigenère Cipher by finding the corresponding rows and columns using the Vigenère table. The project utilizes conditional and iterative loops along with modular arithmetic to perform arithmetic operations within the bounds of the alphabet. By offering a solution to decrypt Vigenère Cipher messages, users can retrieve the original plaintext and understand the content of the encrypted message.

Instructions on how to use this program: 
  1) The program will prompt you to enter 'e' to encrypt or 'd' to decrypt a message. Choose the desired operation by typing 'e' or 'd' and press Enter.
  2) Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt when prompted. Press Enter when finished.
  3) Enter the keyword to be used for encryption or decryption. Press Enter when finished.
  4) The program will process your input and display the result.
  5) If you chose encryption, it will show the encrypted message. If you chose decryption, it will show the decrypted message.
  7) You can run the program again to encrypt or decrypt another message.
